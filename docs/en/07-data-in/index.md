---

This chapter introduces a number of ways which can be used to write data into TDengine, users can use TDengine SQL to write data into TDengine cloud service, or use the [connectors](../../programming/connector) provided by TDengine to program writing into TDengine. TDengine provides [taosBenchmark](../tools/taosbenchmark), which is a performance testing tool to write into TDengine, and taosX, which is a tool provided by TDengine enterprise edition, to sync data from one TDengine cloud service to another. Furthermore, 3rd party tools, like telegraf and prometheus, can also be used to write data into TDengine.
